# Robust Fuzzy Control of Network-Type Re-entrant Manufacturing Systems with Communication Delays
This module contains the script for the simulation study of the simualtion in "Robust Fuzzy Control of Network-Type Re-entrant Manufacturing Systems with Communication Delays", which has been submitted to IEEE Transaction on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers. We checked that this module works on Matlab 2023a with **Robust Control Toolbox​**​.
* sim_system for the numerical simulation with control channel
* sim_system_without_control for the numerical simulation without control channel

### How to run?

1. Download the scripts.
2. Install Robust Control Toolbox.
3. Execute the scripts.
