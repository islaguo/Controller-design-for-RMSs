# Robust Fuzzy Control of Network-Type Re-entrant Manufacturing Systems with Communication Delays
This repository contains the MATLAB scripts for the simulation study presented in the paper "Robust Fuzzy Control of Network-Type Re-entrant Manufacturing Systems with Communication Delays", which has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers. The code has been tested on **MATLAB R2023a** with the **Robust Control Toolbox** installed.
* sim_system.m: Performs the numerical simulation with the control channel, generating the trajectory shown in Fig. 4 of the manuscript.
* sim_system_without_control.m: Performs the numerical simulation without the control channel.

### How to run?

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Ensure that the Robust Control Toolbox is installed in your MATLAB environment.
3. Run the desired script in MATLAB.
